facebookCache
=============

Tool to generate facebook likes and button_count to use on the page without using facebooks SDK.  

Also supplied is a bit of javascript that will allow you to lazy/just-in-time load the faecbook SDK and other
JS bits, so that you can populate a dialog box with the like data and then allow users to like/unlike.

Original theory for building the back-end cache of like count taken from reading:

Special thanks to Jens Roland mail@jensroland.com for helping with the FastFB.js for just-in-time lazy loading of the facebook SDK and like functionality.
